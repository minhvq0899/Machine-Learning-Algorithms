All credit to Tiep Vu (the author of 'Machine Learning co ban') and Aurélien Geron (the author of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow)
I am replicating their code (with a few changes) and adding comments along the way for a studying purpose only

Content of this code:
1. Create toy data
    1.1. Tiep Vu's toy data
    1.2. Aurélien Geron's toy data
2. Build K-mean algorithms using only numpy 
    2.1. Test on X_tiepvu using functions above
    2.2. Test on X_tiepvu using Scikit-learn Kmeans
